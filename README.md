# SiriusFM-39
Training project on financial math (financial math event in Sirius)

INCLUDES :

    * Pricer european option via Monte Carlo simulation (GBM model, CEV model + support risk-neutral measure)
    * Delta-hedging also based on Monte Carlo simulation (GBM model only, FIXIT)
    * Pricer via numerical solution of PDEs (Feynman-Kac and Fokker-Planck)
