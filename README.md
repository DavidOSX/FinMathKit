# FinMathKit
Research project on financial math (option pricing, hedging, interest rate, etc...)

## Includes
1. Pricer for european options via Monte Carlo simulation (GBM model, CEV model + support risk-neutral measure)
2. Delta-hedging which is also based on Monte Carlo simulation (GBM model only, FIXIT)
3. Pricer for options via numerical solution of PDEs (Feynman-Kac and Fokker-Planck)

## Requirements

* c++ compiler
* git
* cmake

## Installation and Testing
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/davidmiheev/FinMathKit/
$ cd FinMathKit/
$ ./sirius.sh
```
